        EthicsNet is building a community, one with the purpose of experimenting
        with different potential techniques to create datasets â€“ examples of
        nice behaviours (such as social norms), to help socialise A.I.

        Machine intelligences will simply amplify and return whatever data we
        give them. Our goal is to advance the field of machine ethics, by
        seeding technology that makes it easy to teach machines about ones
        individual and cultural behavioral preferences.
